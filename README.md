# hello-world

Good day!

  I am Christine B. Sabang, a BSIT-2 student from University of Cebu - Main Campus and I am a student of Miss Jean Marie Amora. I love to eat and I do love Sumail. I want to build my own video game so I can let Sumail play with it, it will be my greatest pleasure. I want to be a programmer but I'm not that good yet, but patience is a virtue. I hope you enjoy reading this content.

Sincerely,
Christine B. Sabang
